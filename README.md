# C-_File_Gen
I'm using Java to speed up the use of creating individual files and the make files needed for them

Main:
  Has an Array List to hold your Atributes
  Has an Array List to hold your functions
  
  It is janky but you can add a variable to function by specifcally going
  functions.at(its spot in the array).add(newVar("something", something); or something along that line
  
Honestly, this is the jankiest possible setup to make functions and variables, but hey it works and it looks cool!

Includes a special constructor class extending the function class to help specify what you actually need

The best way to just test it, is just to test it. 
I use the Eclipse IDE, and just let it run

It will actually generate the files, but the Directory Location is set for my computer
